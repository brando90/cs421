(*
* continuation = is an abstract representation of the control state of a
computer program.
    * the continuation is a data structure that represents the computational
    process at a given point in the process's execution; the created data
    structure can be accessed by the programming language, instead of
    being hidden in the runtime environment.
    * think of it as a GOTO. It tells you where the next control of the
    program goes to
    * Idea/example: use functions to represent the control flow of
    the program
